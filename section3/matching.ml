  :: "cons" add an element into the head of the list. constant time

  @ "append" combine two lists. linear time; it needs to go over all the elements
  of the first lis

  lists are  immutable, so to create new lists you need to create new lists out of
  old ones. 

*)

(*
Note how all the recursive functions above are similar to doing proofs by induction on the natural numbers: every natural number is either 0 or is 1 greater than some other natural number
, and so a proof by induction has a base case for 0 and an inductive case for
. Likewise, all our functions have a base case for the empty list and a recursive case for the list that has one more element than another list. This similarity is no accident. There is a deep relationship between induction and recursion; weâ€™ll explore that relationship in more detail later in the book.

(* increment the first element of a list*)

(*since lists are immutable the main idea here is to create a new list with just
  one element, in this case this is h (head of the list) and point to the later list 
  t (t is the rest of the list). This way, ocaml does not need to allocate a new memory
  for this "new" list.
